# AutoBatFarm
A farm to automatically farm BAT crypto in the brave browser.

Warning I do not know if Brave has a rule against this so use at your own risk.
UPDATE it is breaking breaves rules to use this so I dont recommend using.

This is not a cryptominer it's just an auto ad viewer for the Brave browser so this can run on any device that you can install Brave and Python 3 on.

To install, install brave browser, a version of python 3, the latest release, and when you install it all double click the setup.bat to install all the needed packages.

To run just double click py file after installing everything needed if that doesn't work you can open in Idle version of your choice by right clicking the file and then do f5 when that new window opens to run it there.
